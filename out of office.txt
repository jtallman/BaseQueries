Out of office 

Thank you for your email. 
I am on required furlough today 8/21 and will not be available by phone or email. 
 
I will be back at work on Monday, August 24. For more information about the agency-wide furlough, visit www.ofm.wa.gov.



How do you say "out of the office" when you haven't actually been in the office since February? 
Anyway, I'm offline until Monday August 17. If you need action before then, you will need to contact someone else. If you need action taken by me after then, please feel strongly encouraged to email me again once I'm back in the office, since I expect there will be too much email for me to wade through. 
 
Also, you might want to consider taking some time away as well. 2020 has been a rough year all around and you could probably use a break, even if it's just a long weekend. You've been working hard, and you deserve it.
