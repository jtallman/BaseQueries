Code Snippet
foreach (var m in Model.AllMeasures) { m.Description = m.Expression; } 


It occurred to me that moving all columns into a display folder should be the first thing to do with any new model, and that sounds like a great opportunity to write a script (there is a second bonus script at the end of this post too).

foreach (var c in Model.AllColumns)
    {
        c.DisplayFolder = "_Columns";  // use double backslash for subfolders, e.g. “_Columns\\subfolder”
    }


Hide Columns in Fact Tables Used in Joins
foreach (var r in Model.Relationships)
    {
        r.FromColumn.IsHidden = true;
    }
